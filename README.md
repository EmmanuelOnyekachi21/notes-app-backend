## Linting Script

This project includes a helper script `check_style.sh` which scans Python files for style issues using `pycodestyle`.

### How it works
- The script searches the provided directory for `.py` files.
- Each file is checked with `pycodestyle`.
- If errors are found, the file is opened in VS Code for correction.
- You can choose to skip files interactively.

### Error log file
During the process, linter errors are written to a temporary file:

- **Default name**: `/tmp/pycodestyle_errors.txt`
- The file is automatically deleted when the script exits.
- If the script is interrupted, the file can be safely removed manually:
  ```bash
  rm -f py_errors.txt
  ```
